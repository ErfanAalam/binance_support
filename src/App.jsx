              Please note that blockchain transactions are irreversible and
              anonymous
            </strong>
            . This means that despite our best efforts, it may be unlikely that
            we, as an exchange, can recover the scammed funds.

          <p className="text-sm">
            Although fund recovery isn’t guaranteed, the best course of action
            is to report the incident to law enforcement, who may collaborate
            with experienced blockchain investigators to pursue the theft
            further.
